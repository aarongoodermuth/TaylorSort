TaylorSort
==========

This little java program will take an Itunes playlist and let a user sort the songs according to whatever criteria they want. Then creates file that may be imported into Itunes as a playlist.

The original use for this program was to allow me to sort all Taylor Swift songs from best to worst (in my opinion). 
I then realized it could be used to sort any arbitrary Itunes playlist. 

The program does not make any judgements on songs. It only gives a user two songs at a time and asks which one they like better.
